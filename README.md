# VISCERAL VOID
This mod adds a new custom dimension, the Primordial Void. This entire dimension is completely empty, save for elemental spirits roaming the expanses of stone.

_More to come. Have patience._

# Mobs

### 1. Blaze
Everyone knows the Blaze. Found in nether fortresses, it is the elemental spirit of fire. It attacks via throwing fireballs at its target and attacking anything that comes too close.

### 2. Breeze
A slightly rarer mob, found only in trial chambers. It embodies the power of the wind, tossing Wind Charges at its foes. It has more health than the Blaze and jumps around like a frog, making it a difficult target.

### 3. Bluff
Unlike the Blaze and the Breeze, the Bluff is a passive spirit, serving as a creature of the earth. It wields pellets of dirt and grass, kept aloft by its magic. It drops its single rod upon death.

### 4. Blitz
A pacifist spirit, it roams the sea it calls home. It is shy, preferring to observe anything it takes interest in rather than attack. When killing it, it drops one of its rods.



# Resources

### Null Ingot
It is currently unknown what this odd mineral is used for. It is unbreakable, only found in the stone making up the entire Primordial Void, and rarely at that.

### Elemental Rings
Using 4 of each elemental spirit's rod, you can craft a Ring. This is used for the Elemental Armor, an upgrade to standard Netherite that imbues its wearer with special effects upon set completion.

### Upgrade Templates
4 different upgrade templates, each corresponding to its respective elemental spirit, can be found scattered across the Overworld. Locations are as follows:

**Blaze:** Nether Fortress

**Bluff:** Woodland Mansion

**Breeze:** Trial Chambers (Ominous)

**Blitz:** Buried Treasure
